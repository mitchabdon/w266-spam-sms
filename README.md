# Transformers against SMS spam
**Mitch Abdon and Tanya Flint**  
MIDS W266 Summer 2022 Final Project

## Abstract
This study is motivated by the rampant smishing attacks in the Philippines. The SMS messages offer dubious jobs, products, and cash deals attempting to scam victims into providing sensitive information. Given that SMS messaging remains an important medium of communication in developing countries, effective filtering of SMS spam messages could have wider social impact. In this paper, we demonstrate that, despite limited local-specific and up-to-date training data, our pre-trained transformer-based language model achieved {\color{red} xx\%} accuracy, {\color{red} at par(?)/better(?) xxxxx}. Thus, the languid response in addressing spam SMS is not of lack of available technology but rather on weak incentives due to scale and profits.
